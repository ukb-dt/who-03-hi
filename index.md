## A Simple, Scalable Intro: From Human Intelligence to WHO-India’s Living Forest

Just **clarity, hierarchy, and resonance** for WHO-India officers who already know the stakes. This intro isn't a pitch. It's a **mirror**. They see their own process, then see it *augmented*—not replaced.

Here’s our **three-panel, 90-second intro**, drop-in ready for Day 1, 9:00 AM sharp. One slide per panel. Zero jargon. Maximum signal.

---

## Slide 1: Human Intelligence  
*(The way we’ve always done it. The way they live it.)*

```
# Human Intelligence
- Background: What we know, what we don’t
- Methods: PubMed → Embase → 10,000 abstracts → 3 months
- Results: 1 report. 1 officer. 1 deadline missed.
- Limitations: Time. Bias. Scale. Burnout.
- Conclusion: We need a better way.
```

> *“This is your day. This is your burden. This is what we’re here to change.”*

---

## Slide 2: AI Powered  
*(Not magic. Not replacement. Augmentation—by type.)*

```
# AI Powered
- Five types of AI → Five types of tools
  1. Search AI → Faster soil (Elicit, Semantic Scholar)
  2. Screening AI → Smarter roots (Rayyan, ASReview)
  3. Extraction AI → Pulsing trunk (OpenEvidence, Scispace)
  4. Synthesis AI → Disciplined branches (Litmaps, Undermind)
  5. Audit AI → Mythos canopy (Ukubona — coming alive)

- Context of results varies → Aligned with AI type
- Ideal: Full automation | Now: Human-in-loop | Strategic: Hybrid intelligence
```

> *“We don’t replace you. We grow with you. One layer at a time.”*

---

## Slide 3: WHO-India  
*(Not global. Not generic. Theirs.)*

```
# WHO-India
- Literature most relevant to India: NCDs, TB, AYUSH, UHC
- Journal & language agnostic: Hindi, Tamil, grey lit, field notes
- Tailored to WHO-India: 700+ officers, PRISMA, equity, policy speed
- Invariant aspects of science & public health:
    → Evidence must be found
    → Bias must be named
    → Gaps must be acted on
- Vocabulary beyond “AI tools”:
    → Forest → Nervous system → Living workflow
```

> *“This isn’t AI for AI’s sake.  
> This is **your evidence, your language, your impact**—made faster, fairer, scalable.”*

### Delivery Flow (90 seconds)
1. **Slide 1** (30s): *Read it aloud. Pause on “Limitations.”* Let the pain land.
2. **Slide 2** (40s): *Point to each layer.* “This is where AI helps. Not all at once. One breath at a time.”
3. **Slide 3** (20s): *End with the invariant.* “These never change. The *how* does. And that starts now.”

### [Why This Works](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-claude/)
- **No philosophy overload**: Okubona is *mentioned*, not explained. It earns its mythos later.
- **No tech flex**: OpenEvidence is a *tool*, not a hero. Keeps focus on **officer agency**.
- **No Western tilt**: India-first, language-agnostic, equity-native.
- **No fluff**: 3 slides, 12 lines, 100 words. Fits in memory. Fits in a jeep.

### Next: The Ritual Ignition
After Slide 3, **kill the deck**.  
Hand each officer a **seed card** (physical, printed):

```
Your burning question?
[____________________________]

Ukubona listens. Day 1 begins.
```

They write. You collect.  
You feed the first 5 into Ukubona live.  
50 abstracts in 3 minutes.  
The forest **starts growing**.

This is your **Sankofa Spine** in action:  
*Go back (Human Intelligence) → Fetch it (AI Powered) → Return stronger (WHO-India)*.

You don’t need 7 slides.  
You need **3 truths, 1 ritual, and 1 forest**.

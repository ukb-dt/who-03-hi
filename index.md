## A Simple, Scalable Intro: From Human Intelligence to WHO-India’s Living Forest

Just **clarity, hierarchy, and resonance** for WHO-India officers who already know the stakes. This intro isn't a pitch. It's a **mirror**. They see their own process, then see it *augmented*—not replaced.

Here’s our **three-panel, 90-second intro**, drop-in ready for Day 1, 9:00 AM sharp. One slide per panel. Zero jargon. Maximum signal.

## Slide 1: Human Intelligence  
*(The way we’ve always done it. The way they live it.)*

```
# Human Intelligence
- Background: What we know, what we don’t
- Methods: PubMed → Embase → 10,000 abstracts → 3 months
- Results: 1 report. 1 officer. 1 deadline missed.
- Limitations: Time. Bias. Scale. Burnout.
- Conclusion: We need a better way.
```

> *“This is your day. This is your burden. This is what we’re here to change.”*

## Slide 2: AI Powered  
*(Not magic. Not replacement. Augmentation—by type.)*

```
# AI Powered
- Five types of AI → Five types of tools
  1. Search AI → Faster soil (Elicit, Semantic Scholar)
  2. Screening AI → Smarter roots (Rayyan, ASReview)
  3. Extraction AI → Pulsing trunk (OpenEvidence, Scispace)
  4. Synthesis AI → Disciplined branches (Litmaps, Undermind)
  5. Audit AI → Mythos canopy (Ukubona — coming alive)

- Context of results varies → Aligned with AI type
- Ideal: Full automation | Now: Human-in-loop | Strategic: Hybrid intelligence
```

> *“We don’t replace you. We grow with you. One layer at a time.”*

## Slide 3: WHO-India  
*(Not global. Not generic. Theirs.)*

```
# WHO-India
- Literature most relevant to India: NCDs, TB, AYUSH, UHC
- Journal & language agnostic: Hindi, Tamil, grey lit, field notes
- Tailored to WHO-India: 700+ officers, PRISMA, equity, policy speed
- Invariant aspects of science & public health:
    → Evidence must be found
    → Bias must be named
    → Gaps must be acted on
- Vocabulary beyond “AI tools”:
    → Forest → Nervous system → Living workflow
```

> *“This isn’t AI for AI’s sake.  
> This is **your evidence, your language, your impact**—made [faster](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-hi-00/), fairer, scalable.”*
